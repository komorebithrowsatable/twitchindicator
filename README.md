# twitchindicator

Displays active streams from channels you're following on twitch.
It uses only your login name and nothing else since twitch api allows to see this data just by passing client id.
Now it's a beta version, so don't hesitate to report bugs and request some improvements.

Roadmap:
- add games information to the stream list
- add youtube support
- update the code to support more than 100 active streams, display search if the list is too big
- option to play stream directly in widget. Add pin feature.
- keep it simple
